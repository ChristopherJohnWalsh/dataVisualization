HAFERMAN CARPET

The Haferman carpet is the beautiful fractal constructed 
using string rewriting beginning with a cell and iterating 
the rules.

           1 1 1         0 1 0
       0 > 1 1 1     1 > 1 0 1
           1 1 1         0 1 0
           
       1, 3, 9, 27, 81 ...
       
STRING REWRITING

A substitution system in which rules are used to operate on 
a string consisting of letters of a certain alphabet. 
String rewriting systems are also variously known as 
rewriting systems, reduction systems, or term rewriting systems. 

String rewriting is a particularly useful technique for 
generating successive iterations of certain types of fractals, 
such as the box fractal, Cantor dust, Cantor square fractal, 
and Sierpi≈Ñski carpet.
