IRREDUCIBLE FRACTION

An irreducible fraction is a fraction p/q for which GCD(p,q)=1, 
i.e., p and q are relatively prime. For example, in the complex plane, 
(4+7i)/(2+i)=3+2i is reducible, while (5+5i)/(7+i)=4/5+3i/5 is not.

RELATIVELY PRIMES
Two integers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors (divisors) except 
1. Using the notation (m,n) to denote the greatest common divisor, two integers  m and n are 
relatively prime if (m,n)=1. Relatively prime integers are sometimes also called strangers or 
coprime and are denoted m_|_n. The plot above plots m and n along the two axes and colors 
a squareblack if (m,n)=1 and white otherwise (left figure) and simply colored according to 
(m,n) (right figure).

(2, 3) = 1 or (3, 4) = 1, but (2, 4) is not, equals to 2
