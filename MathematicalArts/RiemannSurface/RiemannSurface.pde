RIEMANN SURFACE

A Riemann surface is a surface-like configuration that covers 
the complex plane with several, and in general infinitely many, 
"sheets." These sheets can have very complicated structures 
and interconnections (Knopp 1996, pp. 98-99). 

Riemann surfaces are one way of representing multiple-valued 
functions; another is branch cuts. The above plot shows Riemann 
surfaces for solutions of the equation:

     MathWorld examples: 
     
     [w * (z)] ^ d + w * (z) + z ^ (d - 1) = 0 
     with d =2, 3, 4, and 5, where w(z) is the Lambert W-function 

The Riemann surface S of the function field K is the set of nontrivial 
discrete valuations on K. Here, the set S corresponds to the ideals of 
the ring A of integers of K over C(z). (A consists of the elements of K 
that are roots of monic polynomials over C[z].) Riemann surfaces provide 
a geometric visualization of functions elements and their 
analytic continuations.

There is a plenty of Riemann surfaces of different kinds: ellipstic, parabolic, hyperbolic
and etc.

FUNCTION FIELD

A finite extension K=Q(z)(w) of the field Q(z) of rational functions in 
the indeterminate z, i.e., w is a root of a polynomial a_0+a_1alpha+a_2alpha^2+...+a_nalpha^n, 
where a_i in Q(z). Function fields are sometimes called algebraic function fields.
