PHASE PORTRAIT

A phase portrait is a geometric representation of the trajectories 
of a dynamical system in the phase plane. Each set of initial 
conditions is represented by a different curve, or point.

Phase portraits are an invaluable tool in studying dynamical systems. 
They consist of a plot of typical trajectories in the state space. 
This reveals information such as whether an attractor, a repellor or 
limit cycle is present for the chosen parameter value. The concept 
of topological equivalence is important in classifying the behaviour 
of systems by specifying when two different phase portraits represent 
the same qualitative dynamic behavior.

A phase portrait graph of a dynamical system depicts the system's 
trajectories (with arrows) and stable steady states (with dots) and 
unstable steady states (with circles) in a state space. 
The axes are of state variables.

EXAMPLE:
A potential of simple pendulum
